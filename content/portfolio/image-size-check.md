During my time at [Sharecare](./intern-software-engineering.md) I would need to verify that images were being used at an appropriate size. To avoid having to check the network tab and manually verify image sizes, I developed a Chrome extension to assist in assessing an image actual size versus the size it is presented as.

The extension now has thousands of users and a 4+ rating on the Google Chrome Web Store.
