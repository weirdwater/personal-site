Tech support at home. Talking with clients to figure out whatâ€™s wrong. Analysing the current state of a machine ( Macs, PCs, tablets,TVs, home networks, etc.). Informing the client of the current state and advising possible solutions. After talking to the client I would proceed to fix the problem.
