Since 1954 every summer volunteers from the Woerden region set-up and organise a week long event for the children of Woerden. During the day free activities for kids, financed by events in the evening for the whole family. Today it is a full-blown festival with a maximum of 8000 visitors crowding the field.

With a crew of two, we would produce 30-35 videos in a span of 9 days, giving visitors a chance to relive the different events of the week.
