As part of the 3rd year internship of my HBO Bachelors, I interned at Sharecare, Inc. in Atlanta GA. During the internship I was part of the Performance team, identifying slow pages on sharecare.com and improving their performance. Helped transition to microservices by providing performance improvement suggestions. Led a A/B test comparing different versions of a module designed to improve CTR on low performing pages.
