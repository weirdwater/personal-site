summary: Perormance tool as a Browser Extension with thousands of users for verifying image sizes on websites.
---

While performing performance work on websites I would need to verify that images were being used at an appropriate size. As serving images in a larger format than they are displayed is a waste of resources. To avoid having to check the network tab and manually verify image sizes, I developed a Chrome extension to assist in assessing an image actual size versus the size it is presented as.

The extension now has thousands of users and a 4+ rating on the Google Chrome Web Store.
