Initially created to deliver blog posts for school assignments. Now used to showcase my experience and generate my CV.

The site is generated using Hugo, which is a static site generator written in Go. Content management is done as markdown files and templating is done using Go templating.

Served using nginx and it has SSL using Let's Encrypt.
